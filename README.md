# Boilerplate Project

A boilerplate project created in flutter using MobX and Provider. Boilerplate supports both web and mobile, clone the appropriate branches mentioned below:

* For Mobile: https://github.com/zubairehman/flutter-boilerplate-project/tree/master (stable channel)
* For Web: https://github.com/zubairehman/flutter-boilerplate-project/tree/feature/web-support (beta channel)

## Getting Started

The Boilerplate contains the minimal implementation required to create a new library or project. The repository code is preloaded with some basic components like basic app architecture, app theme, constants and required dependencies to create a new project. By using boiler plate code as standard initializer, we can have same patterns in all the projects that will inherit it. This will also help in reducing setup & development time by allowing you to use same code pattern and avoid re-writing from scratch.
